## Omegle clone using WebRTC (p2p)

This project is a real-time, peer-to-peer video conferencing system built with WebRTC, React, and TypeScript. It enables users to engage in high-quality video calls directly with each other, without the need for a centralized server for the media stream, leveraging the power of WebRTC's peer-to-peer technology.
